## Description
As a user,
I want to be able to add and modify product details, assign a location and technician to the product, and use a start/stop timer to track work duration,
So that I can efficiently manage the progress of product development and maintenance, ensure accountability, and optimize the productivity of my team.
## Installation
Install Node.js, if needed.
Create a .gitignore file and include "node_modules", ".env", ".vscode", "package-lock.json", and ".DS_Store" in it, so that these files aren't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Be sure to create your .gitignore file before installing any npm dependencies.
Make sure that your repo includes a package.json with the required dependencies. You can create one by running "npm init" when you first set up the project, before installing any dependencies.
This application requires the Express package. To install Express, navigate to your terminal and enter "npm install express".
